			<p>Visual hierarchy is the principle of arranging elements to show their order of importance. Designers structure visual characteristics—e.g., menu icons—so users can understand information easily. By laying out elements logically and strategically, designers influence users’ perceptions and guide them to desired actions.
                In user interface (UI) design, an effective visual hierarchy helps inform, impress and persuade users, who have expectations – especially about an interface’s appearance. So, for a website, app or related product to succeed, it’s crucial to structure its pages or screens to minimize users’ uncertainty, show maximum empathy with them and give them something pleasant to view.

				The rule of thirds is a "rule of thumb" for composing visual images such as designs, films, paintings, and photographs.[1] The guideline proposes that an image should be imagined as divided into nine equal parts by two equally spaced horizontal lines and two equally spaced vertical lines, and that important compositional elements should be placed along these lines or their intersections.[2] Proponents[who?] of the technique claim that aligning a subject with these points creates more tension, energy and interest in the composition than simply centering the subject.

                The photograph on the right demonstrates the application of the rule of thirds. The horizon in the photograph sits at the horizontal line dividing the lower third of the photo from the upper two-thirds. The tree sits at the intersection of two lines, sometimes called a power point[3] or a crash point.[4]

				<h4>White Space and Clean Design</h4>

				White space, also known as “negative space,” is empty space around the content and functional elements of a page. The basic role of white space is to let your design breathe by reducing the amount of text and functional elements that users see at once.

                Despite being called “white,” this space doesn’t literally need to be white. Any type of space that serves as a background for the content or functional elements can be considered white space.
