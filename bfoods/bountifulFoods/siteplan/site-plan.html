        school on time. Due to this she does not have much time to do shopping. She orders from the
        Bountiful Foods website in bulk and has fresh fruits delivered to her door step, this saves her a lot of
        time and does not affect her daily activity.

        remotely but still desires a morning fruit drink to get his day going. He orders
        from the Bountiful Foods online website for delivery to his current work space.
